Height,ft,"
Height is used in the Standards to measure the vertical extent of a building component e.g. Wall, or the vertical distance between two building components e.g. between the ceiling and the roof."
Length,ft,"
The Standards use length and width interchangeably.  For example the Display Perimeter which is the horizontal dimension of a vertical surface is defined as the length of an exterior wall, but the horizontal dimension for window which is also a vertical surface is referred to as width. 
 
Length measures the longest extent from one end to the other of a building component that lies in the horizontal place such as a floor or ceiling, or the longest extent of a building material. 
 
The shortest extent is the Width"
Width,ft,"

The Standards use length and width interchangeably.  For example the Display Perimeter which is the horizontal dimension of a vertical surface is defined as the length of an exterior wall, but the horizontal dimension for window which is also a vertical surface is referred to as width. 
 
"
Thickness,ft,"

Thickness is the measure of the distance between inner and outer surfaces of a building component or material.  It is always given in inches which can be converted to feet"
Area,ft2,"
There is no formal defintion of the measurement of area in Title 24 Part 6.  There is a definition for conditioned floor area which states that it is the floor area (in square feet)
 
The dimensions of rectangular surfaces such as walls, windows, floors needs to be calculated to get the area of the surface.  "
Azimuth,deg arc,"

T24 Part 6 never mentions azimuth even in its definition of cardinal orientations.  JA has one table that depends on the  azimuth: Table NA4-1.   However, the Res ACM and the NR ACM use azimuth extensively.  e.g. Res ACM:  3.5.5-Reporting requirements on CF-1R; 3.7.7-Fenestration Calculations; Appendix B-Algorithms and Procedures for Calculating PV Production;  NR ACM: 2.3.3.3 Surface Azimuth and Tilt of Exterior Partitions

Time Dependent Valuation (TDV) Gas Propane,kBtu per thm,"

Thermal Conductivity,Btu per h ft F,"
This is referred to as F-Factor and is defined in a measurement of heat transfer in Btu/(hr x ft x F).  It is used mainly for floor slabs,  because heat loss is more closely proportional to the length of the perimeter of the slab than to its area, F-factor is represented by heat over a distance rather than heat over an area.  Essentially, the only difference between F-factor and U-factor is that U-factor is over an area whereas F-factor is over just length (ft2 vs. ft).  PB"
Volume,ft3,Title 24 and JA II have a definition for conditioned volume as follows: CONDITIONED VOLUME is the total volume (in cubic feet) of the conditioned space within a building
U Factor,Btu per h ft2 F,"

T24 Part 6 and JA II definitions:
U-FACTOR is the overall coefficient of thermal transmittance of a construction assembly, in Btu/(hr x ft² x ºF),"
Heat Capacity,Btu per ft2 F,"
Title 24 and JA II both define Heat Capacity as the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of all the components of a unit area in an assembly by 1°F.
 
In JA IV Heat capacity (HC) values are provided in Tables 4.3.5  to Table 4.3.12  and HC units are defined in Table 4.6.2 
 
New 2013 NR ACM states: ... use volume, density, and specific heat of the component wall materials to calculate the heat capacity"
Thermal Energy,Btu,"There is no definition for thermal energy in the Standards, however Btu unit is used to express heating and cooling energy e.g. definition of Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) is the total cooling output ...in Btu; Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) is the total heating output ...(in Btu)

Both Title 24 and JA II have a definition that refers to thermal energy in the definition of Site Solar Energy
 "
Energy per Area,Btu per ft2,"In Title 24 Section 141 (a) Energy Budget defines the units ""expressed in Btu per square foot of conditioned floor area per year"" 
Conflict:  Section 141 (a)1. Space-conditioning budget states that the space-conditioning budget is the TDV energy which are different units, specifically: kBtu/therm for gas and propane, and kBtu/kWh for electricity."
Thermal Capacity,Btu per h," Title 24 Part 6 and NR ACM use the unit Btu/h  to express the capacity or size of different HVAC equipment e.g. Tables 112A,B and E.   "
Occupant Density,,NR ACM assigns occupancy loads in units of people per 1000 square feet in tables N2-5 and N2-6
Volumetric Flowrate per Area,ft3 per min ft2,
Tilt,deg arc,Usually the term slope is used to mean Tilt in the Standards
Density,lb per ft3,"When used with material, Density is expressed as mass/area.  For example the Density of roofing products is expressed in lb/ft2 but in JA 4 it is used as mass/volume.  However, elsewhere in JA 4 the density of materials is expressed as lb/ft3
"
Specific Heat,Btu per lb F,"There is no formal definition of Specific Heat
 
JA 4 in Table 4.6.2 – Rules for Calculating Mass Thermal Properties From Published Values  Specific Heat (SH) units are defined as Btu/ºF-lb"
Electrical Power,W,"The most common usage in the Standards is for expressing lighting electrical energy in watts.  There are also a number of energy efficiency rating systems for HVAC equipment that are used in the Standards that use electrical energy expressed in SI units of watts or kilowatts in the calculations including EER, HSPF and SEER"
Mass Per Unit of Area,lb per ft2,"In Title 24 Part 6 there are references to lb/ft2 which are called ""weight"". For example Section 143(a)1 has exceptions that refer to the weight of the roofing product as so many pounds per square foot.  This measurement is also called ""density"" in various places in the Standards
 
Unfortunately in JA IV weight is used with units of lb/ft3 which should be density e.g. Table 4.3.5 – Properties of Hollow Unit Masonry Walls has several weight classifiers and the text defines them as lb/ft3"
R Value,h ft2 F per Btu,THERMAL RESISTANCE (R) is the resistance of a material or building component to the passage of heat in (hr x ft² x ºF)/Btu.
Time Dependent Valuation (TDV) Electricity,kBtu per kW h,"Title 24 Section 101 – Definitions and Rules of Construction and Appendix JA3 – Time Dependent Valuation (TDV)JA3.1 Scope and Purpose:  The currency used to compare energy performance
"
Sensible Heat Rate Per Occupant ,Btu per h person,NR ACM Table Table N2-5 and N2-6 assign values for Sensible Heat per person
Latent Heat Rate Per Occupant ,Btu per h person,NR ACM Table Table N2-5 and N2-6 assign values for Latent Heat per person
C Factor,Btu per h ft2 F,"JA 1 glossary defines C-VALUE (ALSO KNOWN AS C-FACTOR): the time rate of heat flow through unit area of a body induced by a unit temperature difference between the body surfaces, in Btu (hr. x ft.2 x °F). 

The JA IV tables all refer to C-Factor and never mention C-Value
"
Power Density Area,W per ft2,Power Density Area is used for calculating lighting power density and receptacle loads
Weight,lb,"NR ACM uses the weight of materials and furniture and expresses it is pounds per square foot.
 
Joint Appendix 4 Table 4.6.2 assigns Weight property the units of lb/ft2
 
Appendix RA3 uses weight to mean mass and uses the phrase weight-per-square-foot to express the areal density"
inch,in,"There are a few measurements in inches for short lengths that would be difficult for inspectors to use when checking for compliance 
Example:
Table 116-A Note 1a instructs users to adjust UFactor if the width of a spacer in a double pane window is less than 7/16 in    "
