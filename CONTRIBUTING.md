# Contributing to OpenStudio

We'd love for you to contribute to OpenStudio to make it better than it is today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Follow Along](#follow)
 - [Code Submission](#submit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Please direct questions about how to use OpenStudio to [unmethours](https://unmethours.com).  This is a community moderated resource and will provide the fastest answers to your questions.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [issues page](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues). Before submitting your issue please search existing issues to see if your bug has already been reported.  If reporting a new issue, please be as detailed as you can be in your report to help developers reproduce your issue so they can fix the problem.  For example, report the platform that you are on, the version of OpenStudio you are using, etc. Before reporting an issue please read our [wiki entry](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Issue-Prioritization) for instructions on properly labelling issues.

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a better Feature?
You can request a feature enhancement by submitting an issue to our [issues page](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues).  Before submitting your issue please search existing issues to see if your request has already been reported.  If requesting a new enhancement, please be as detailed as you can be in your report to help developers understand what you are looking for. Before reporting a feature enhancement please read our [wiki entry](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Issue-Prioritization) for instructions on properly labelling issues. Note that an enhancement is NOT a bug!

## <a name="follow"></a> Want to Follow Along?
You can follow the progress and activity on issues important to you in several ways.  Subscribe to notifications on an issue to get emailed whenever there is activity on that specific issue. Commenting on an issue will allow you to give your inputs and will also subscribe you.  Finally, if you want to support bug fix or feature requests that are important to you, use the +1 reaction on the first comment in the issue thread.  This will help us prioritize which issues are most important to users.

## <a name="submit"></a> Want to Submit Code?
If you want to directly submit code to implement a feature or fix a bug then you are our hero.  Small patches or bug fixes are invited via pull requests.  Please read the [information for third party collaborators](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Information-for-Third-Party-Collaborators) wiki entry for information about this process. However, larger features or substantial development requires following the [OpenStudio contribution policy](https://www.openstudio.net/openstudio-contribution-policy).
